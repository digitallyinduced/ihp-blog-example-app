# ihp-blog-example-app
Example project showing the project structure of a simple blog app built with [IHP](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp) as described in the Section [Your First Project](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/your-first-project.html).

After following the steps to install [IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/installation.html), you can run this app locally by running:

```bash
devenv up
```

This will automatically deal with installing all dependencies, setting up the development database and importing fixtures.
